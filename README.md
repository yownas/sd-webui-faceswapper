# sd-webui-faceswapper
Extension to swap faces in Stable Diffusion webui

# Installation
This is just an experiment. Install as all other extensions.

Requires you to download inswapper_128.onnx and place it in the sd-webui-faceswapper folder.

It might break, and not work with some other extensions who need another version of the insightface package. I can not help you.
